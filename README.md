# 1) Hardware

## 1.1) Hardware Requirements

- [Dragonboard-410c](https://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/)
- Compatible HDMI Monitor

## 1.2) Hardware Setup

Both the Flick 3D and PIR Sensor are connected via a 3.3v level shifter, these can be easily found in either the [Audio Mezzanine](https://www.96boards.org/product/audio-mezzanine/) or the [Sensor Mezzanine](https://www.96boards.org/product/sensors-mezzanine/).

- **Flick 3D Gesture Sensor**

| Flick 3D | 96Boards 3.3v |
|:--------:|:-------------:|
| VCC      | 3.3v          |
| GND      | GND           |
| SDA      | I2C1_SDA      |
| SCL      | I2C1_SCL      |
| TS       | GPIO K        |
| RST      | GPIO L        |

- **PIR Sensor**

| Flick 3D | 96Boards 3.3v |
|:--------:|:-------------:|
| VCC      | 3.3v          |
| GND      | GND           |
| SIG      | GPIO J        |


# 2) Software

## 2.1) Build Environment Setup

> Note due to the use of mraa, it is recommended to either run everything with ```sudo``` or login as root

### Setup ZRAM Swap

Although the project itself doesn't consume much RAM, the Qt Creator IDE can be
resource hungry so to be on the safe side its better to follow [this guide](https://www.96boards.org/documentation/consumer/guides/zram_swapspace.md.html)
to prevent random lock-ups.

### Install Qt5

- Make sure your Dragonboard-410c is connected to the internet.
- ```$ sudo apt install qt-creator libqt5* qt5*```

### Setting up project in Qt Creator

- Clone this repository:
  - ```$ git clone https://github.com/96boards-projects/magic-mirror```
- Open Qt Creator
  - Menu -> Programming -> Qt Creator
- Create a new QT Quick Project
  - New Project -> Qt Quick Application Swipe -> Give it an appropriate name -> Keep pressing next and accept the default config
- Copy Magic-Mirror Source Files
  - Copy all files from the repo folder to the project folder and replace existing Files

## 2.2) API-Keys

### Generate API Keys

The application requires api-keys for live updates for weather and news. To get the
api-keys and learn how to use the api data:

- [openweathermap](http://api.openweathermap.org)
- [newsapi](http://newsapi.org)

### Place api-keys in Source

Replace the following strings after adding your api-keys

- Page2Form.ui.qml line 27
- Page3Form.ui.qml line 9

## 2.3) Running the Application

Press the green play button or use Ctrl+R to run the application and you should see an output similar to this:
